Version 1.0.0 should include:
- Email notifications every 24 hours after latest commit
- Properly working database with service username, email, and account name
- I don't know.

The following is mostly a bunch of random thoughts that are public. If anyone
wants to contribute or help, possibly creating an open issue based on one of
these or sending a PR regarding one of these, or even just saying one of these
is a good or bad idea would be great.

- Alternative notification methods (texts, calls, push notifications, etc.)

- Allowing setting arbitrary amount of time after commit to be notified

- Defining own notification message(s)

- Having different messages based on time since last commit (i.e. message A
  after 24 hours, message B after 72 hours, etc.)

- Supporting BitBucket, GitLab, Heroku (?), self-served git servers
