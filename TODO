Version 1.0.0 should include:
- Email notifications every 24 hours after latest commit
- Properly working database with service username, email, and account name
- Only API. No front-end work needed for the front-end, such as the sitee. I
  expect a number of changes to happen after v1 - changes dictated somewhat by
  using the product and making the site - and I'd like to have a clear
  separation between the two milestones. v1 should still work just fine even
  after v2 is released as a non-graphical, simplistic approach to using the
  service.

The following is mostly a bunch of random thoughts that are public. If anyone
wants to contribute or help, possibly creating an open issue based on one of
these or sending a PR regarding one of these, or even just saying one of these
is a good or bad idea would be great.

- Alternative notification methods (texts, calls, push notifications, etc.)

- Allowing setting arbitrary amount of time after commit to be notified

- Defining own notification message(s)

- Having different messages based on time since last commit (i.e. message A
  after 24 hours, message B after 72 hours, etc.)

- Supporting BitBucket, GitLab, Heroku (?), self-served git servers

How should authentication be dealt with? How should one confirm it's not only
their email, but they're also getting notifications for the account they wish
to monitor.

- Emails should have a "Not expecting this email?" sort of thing.
