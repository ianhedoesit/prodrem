# prodrem

ProdRem (working name) is a productivity reminder based on git commits.
Currently a work in process, the plan for version 1.0.0 is to notify user by
email when they haven't made a commit to Github in 24 hours.

## Prerequisites

You will need [Leiningen][] 2.0.0 or above installed.

[leiningen]: https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen

## TODO

There is still plenty to do, the hope is also to add much more functionality in
the future, including

- Alternative notification methods (texts, calls, push notifications, etc.)
- Allowing setting arbitrary amount of time after commit to be notified
- Defining own notification message(s)
- Having different messages based on time since last commit (i.e. message A
  after 24 hours, message B after 72 hours, etc.)
- Supporting BitBucket, GitLab, Heroku (?), self-served git servers
- More

Check [TODO][] for more.
